# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing tcarbon table application with advanced interactive controls and visual effects. The enhancement focuses on providing users with granular control over table elements through context menus, cell type management, and dynamic animations. The goal is to create a more engaging and powerful table editing experience while maintaining the carbon-inspired aesthetic and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Context Menu System

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want to right-click on cells, rows, and columns to access contextual actions, so that I can efficiently manage table content and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on a cell THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with cell-specific options
2. WHEN a user right-clicks on a row THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with row-specific options including animation triggers
3. WHEN a user right-clicks on a column THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with column-specific options
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the context menu THEN the system SHALL close the menu
5. IF a context menu is already open THEN the system SHALL close it before opening a new one
6. WHEN a user presses the Escape key THEN the system SHALL close any open context menu

### Requirement 2: Cell Type Management

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want to change cell types (numeric, date, string, etc.) through the context menu, so that I can properly format and validate different types of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Change Cell Type" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL display available cell type options (text, number, currency, percentage, date)
2. WHEN a user changes a cell type THEN the system SHALL update the cell's formatting and validation rules
3. WHEN a cell type is changed to numeric THEN the system SHALL validate numeric input and show appropriate formatting
4. WHEN a cell type is changed to date THEN the system SHALL provide date picker functionality and validate date formats
5. WHEN a cell type is changed to currency THEN the system SHALL apply currency formatting with configurable currency symbol
6. IF a cell value cannot be converted to the new type THEN the system SHALL show a warning and maintain the original value

### Requirement 3: Row and Column Controls

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want to insert, delete, and manipulate rows and columns through context menus, so that I can efficiently restructure my table layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on a row THEN the system SHALL provide options to insert row above, insert row below, delete row, and highlight row
2. WHEN a user right-clicks on a column THEN the system SHALL provide options to insert column left, insert column right, delete column, and sort column
3. WHEN a user selects "Insert Row Above" THEN the system SHALL add a new empty row above the selected row
4. WHEN a user selects "Insert Row Below" THEN the system SHALL add a new empty row below the selected row
5. WHEN a user selects "Delete Row" THEN the system SHALL remove the selected row after confirmation
6. WHEN a user selects "Delete Column" THEN the system SHALL remove the selected column after confirmation
7. IF the table has only one row or column THEN the system SHALL disable the delete option

### Requirement 4: Animation System

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want to trigger various animations on table elements, so that I can create visually engaging presentations and highlight important data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Highlight" from a row context menu THEN the system SHALL trigger a fire animation effect on the entire row
2. WHEN a user selects animation options THEN the system SHALL provide multiple animation types (fire, pulse, shake, glow, bounce, fade)
3. WHEN an animation is triggered THEN the system SHALL play the animation for a configurable duration (2-5 seconds)
4. WHEN multiple animations are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them without performance degradation
5. WHEN an animation is playing THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue editing other parts of the table
6. IF an animation is already playing on an element THEN the system SHALL either queue the new animation or replace the current one based on animation type

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Cell Editing

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want advanced editing capabilities for different cell types, so that I can input and format data more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits a date cell THEN the system SHALL provide a date picker interface
2. WHEN a user edits a numeric cell THEN the system SHALL provide number validation and formatting options
3. WHEN a user edits a currency cell THEN the system SHALL provide currency symbol selection and decimal precision controls
4. WHEN a user tabs through cells THEN the system SHALL maintain the appropriate input method for each cell type
5. WHEN a user enters invalid data for a cell type THEN the system SHALL show validation feedback and prevent invalid values
6. IF a cell has formatting rules THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically during editing

### Requirement 6: Visual Feedback and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want clear visual feedback for all interactions and animations, so that I can understand the system state and create accessible content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a context menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear visual indicators for menu items and keyboard shortcuts
2. WHEN an animation is playing THEN the system SHALL provide visual cues about the animation state
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL show appropriate hover states and tooltips
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL maintain focus indicators and support standard accessibility patterns
5. WHEN animations are disabled by user preference THEN the system SHALL respect the reduced motion settings
6. IF screen readers are detected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements for dynamic content

### Requirement 7: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a table editor, I want smooth performance even with complex animations and large tables, so that I can work efficiently without system lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are playing THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on modern browsers
2. WHEN the table has more than 100 rows THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization or optimization to maintain responsiveness
3. WHEN multiple animations are active THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration and efficient rendering techniques
4. WHEN context menus are opened THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
5. WHEN cell types are changed THEN the system SHALL update the display within 200ms
6. IF the system detects performance issues THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce animation complexity or disable non-essential effects
